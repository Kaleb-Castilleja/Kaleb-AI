					<h2>Me and the blog</h2>
					<p>Welcome to my website, where I'll be posting my art and writing about the Bible (mostly). My name is Kaleb Castilleja and I'm from San Antonio, TX. From the moment Jesus found me, I surrounded my life with the teachings and stories of the Bible. I meditate on them everyday  and obey His commandments so that I might do His will.</p>
					<br>
					<p>I have found that teaching subjects one concept at a time builds the best understanding of complex things. This blog will help mature and advance your understanding of the biblical narrative and how it applies to your life so that you can share it with others. If you need to talk to me about anything at all you can email me or message me on Instagram.</p>
					<h2>More about me</h2>
					<p>I'm an undergraduate in college majoring in Digital Media. I followed graphic design in high school and I'm learning to write on the web. I'm a proficient learner and it's always been my goal to help others. I'm devoted and since meeting Jesus, I'm a lot kinder too. I hope to demonstrate God's character through my life. I've illustrated my skills and interests in the graphics below.</p>
